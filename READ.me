🤖 AI Assistant PDF Learner
An ultra-fast, privacy-conscious RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) application built for the 2026 AI ecosystem. This tool allows users to upload PDF documents and engage in a natural language conversation with the content using the high-speed Groq LPU inference engine.

🚀 Key Features
Near-Instant Responses: Leveraging Groq's LPU technology for sub-second inference.

Local Vectorization: Uses Hugging Face all-MiniLM-L6-v2 for private, cost-free embeddings.

Modular Design: Built with the 2026 standard for LangChain 0.3 modular packages.

Local Persistence: Uses ChromaDB to store your document vectors directly on your machine.

🏗️ System Architecture
The application follows a decoupled RAG pipeline:

Ingestion: Processes PDFs into semantic chunks and stores them in a local vector database.

Retrieval: Searches for relevant document snippets based on the user's query.

Generation: Constructs a context-aware prompt for the Groq Llama 3.3 model to generate an answer.

🛠️ Tech Stack
LLM: Llama 3.3-70b (via Groq API)

Orchestration: LangChain 0.3 (Modular)

Embeddings: Hugging Face sentence-transformers

Vector DB: ChromaDB

Interface: Streamlit
